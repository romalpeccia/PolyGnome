The PolyGnome is a VST3 Sequencer Plugin which helps music producers generate polyrhythms within their Digital Audio Workstation

The process of experimenting and implementing complex polyrhythms within DAWs is complex, and PolyGnome aims to simplify this

With PolyGnome, you can easily visualize, create, and edit 12 simultaneous 8-bar MIDI sequences, where each sequence in each bar is subdivided into 1-16 subdivisions

Each beat of each subdivision sequence can be individually toggled to add space to your rhythm.

These sequences can be fine tuned in real time, making it easier to compose and integrate polyrhythms into your music.  

Finally! You'll never struggle to make a 16:15:14:13:12:11:10:9:8:7:6:5:4:3:2:1 polyrhythm again! (But please don't)
