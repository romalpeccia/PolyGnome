# PolyGnome: VST3 Sequencer Plugin

## Introduction


**PolyGnome** is a VST3 Sequencer Plugin designed to help music producers generate complex polyrhythms within their Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The process of experimenting and implementing complex polyrhythms within DAWs can be intricate; PolyGnome simplifies this process.

With **PolyGnome**, you can easily visualize, create, and edit up to 12 simultaneous 8-bar MIDI sequences. Each sequence in each bar can be subdivided into 1-16 subdivisions, and each beat of each subdivision sequence can be individually toggled to add variety to your rhythm.

These sequences can be fine-tuned in real-time, making it easier to compose and integrate polyrhythms into your music. With PolyGnome, you'll never struggle with creating a 16:15:14:13:12:11:10:9:8:7:6:5 polyrhythm again!.
